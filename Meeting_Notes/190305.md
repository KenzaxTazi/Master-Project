# Meeting notes

## 5th March 2019

### List of actions completed

- Made the analysis functions genralised to CNN and Supermodel.
- Investigated the models' accuracy, confidence and ROCs for different cloud types. Low accuracy for the broken clouds may be due to the time difference between CALIOP and SLSTR data.
- Tried to do the same with the 'clear' subtypes but no aerosols were picked up by CALIOP in the dataset.
- Created confidence plots for surface types as well.

### Questions

- Would it be more useful to have a table with these values in a table rather than histograms?
- Would be worth giving the number of data points in each category?
