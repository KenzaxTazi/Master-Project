## Material for meeting 10/12/18

#Tom 

#Kenza 

Things Kenza did this week:
* Added ancillary data to the network 
* Run the code on whole images 
* Investigated the upward slope in for the precision vs recall curve
* Increased the validation set to 15% of the data
* Investigate the difference between different CALIOP files 
  - Level 3 products contain monthly-averaged parameters that are mapped onto a uniform spatial grid.
  - Level 4 products contain model output or results from analyses of lower level data, e.g., variables derived from multiple     measurements.
  - The highest quality data products generated by the DMS are referred to as Standard data products. These products have a 2-4 day latency to incorporate the global meteorological and other reference products.
  - Expedited data product have a shorter production latency because they use the latest meteorological and calibration parameters available at the time of data production. Not recommended as a basis for research findings. 
  
* Looked into the corellation btw bayes masks and the model output 
* Used slicing to look at accuracy as a function of time difference
