# Material for meeting 23/10/18

We are now running code, uploading and dowmloading data on the cluster. We have connected the Spyder to the shell so we can run scripts through it. 

We also trained a convolutional neural network to differentiate between cat and dog pictures, see teaser_network.py .

This meeting:
- go through neural network code

Work for next meeting:
- get Pacific Ocean images to train 
- adapt the model for satellite images
