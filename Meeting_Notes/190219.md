# Meeting Notes

## 19th February 2019

List of actions completed:

- Data

  - removed pixels with night flags from our training/validation dataset.
  - padded and interpolated the stars using continuous methods

- FFN
  - FFN model now reaches an average accuracy of ~88%.
  - created a new decorater: DataAnalyser which performs the previous test for any FFN model saved without having to retrain it.

- CNN
  - with better data preparation the CNN model is now reaching ~80% accuracy however applying the model to a whole image is very time consumming (> 20 min)
    - CNN's raw input array is ~ 10 GB.
      - Issues with memory allocation, fix will require reprogramming to classify subsections of image and then rejoining rather than processing full image at once
      - Expect this to take > 10 minutes per SLSTR file
  - CNN is only trained on 5 months of 2018 so far
  - Model is prone to overtraining. 
  - Small bug where actual star input is rotated 45 degrees and reflected from the expected input, doubtful this has any real effect
  - Output agrees with FFN ~80% of time
  - From analysis on the 5 months of data, the FFN and CNN both classify the same pixel incorrectly ~ 6% of the time.

- Combined Model
  - Process
    - Data from SLSTR is firstly fed into the FFN
    - Pixels where FFN prediction certainty is between 25% - 75% certain are then fed into the CNN
    - CNN's output is then used instead of FFN for these uncertain pixels
  - So far only tested on a couple images
    - Typically the Combined Model mask agrees with the original FFN mask ~ 97% of the time.


- Other
  - created a reproducibilty method to give an average and standard deviation for model accuracy when presented with the same data.
  - worked on our Research Interfaces poster.



For next week or later:

- make our test methods more general (applicable to CNN and SuperModel)
- polar map with averages and surface types before we submit our RI poster.
