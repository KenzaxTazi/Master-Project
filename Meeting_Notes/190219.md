# Meeting Notes

## 19th February 2019

List of actions completed:

- Data

  - removed the night flags from our dataset.
  - downloaded more contextual data: # stars over # months.
  - padded and interpolated the stars correctly. 

- FNN
  - FFN model now reaches an average accuracy of __%.
  - created a new decorater: DataAnalyser which performs the previous test for any FFN model saved without having to retrain it.

- CNN
  - with correct padding and nan interpolation the CNN model is now reaching __% accuracy however applying the model to a whole image is very time consumming (> 20 min)

- Other
  - created a reproducibilty method to give an average and standard deviation for model accuracy when presented with the same data.
  - worked on our Research Interfaces poster.


For next week or later:

- implement a new star shape.
- polar map with averages before we submit our RI poster.
