# Meeting 
## 29th January 2019

Completed actions:
- found that the misidentified pixels are centred on mid probabilities (o.4-0.7)
    - use this range (perhaps in combonation with poor performing surface type) as criteria for using the cnn
- wrote outline for CNN 

Plot of ~3 million collocated pixels on each pole. Yellow represents a correct model prediction while purple represent an incorrect classification.
