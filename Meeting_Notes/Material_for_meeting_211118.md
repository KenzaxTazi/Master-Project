# Material for meeting on 21/11/18

We are succesfully training our network on CALIOP data. 

Tom has streamlined to dowload and collocation function to make less calls


Kenza has written some functions to evaluate
* The accuracy
* The accuracy vs number of inputs
* A ROC curve 
* The AUC 
* A precision vs recall curve
* A confusion matrix 

She also lloked into meshing alternative network stuctures to make the model more accurate:
* Reinforcment learning: un-supervised method, unsuitable as the performance is linked to weather cloud can be directly identified 
* Recurrent network, supervised method., allows information to transported backwards and forwards. This could potentially be useful. 
*

Also need to think about most appropiate minimasation algorithm (optimiser). We are currently using: 

### Limitations
We plotted about 200 images the model seems to be failing: 
* Snow..
* Coastline...
* Blabla...

### Comments 
* For some reason we cannot access the latest V3 files. Permission is denied by NASA.

### For next week
* smt...
* smt...
* smt...
