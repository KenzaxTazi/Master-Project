Material for meeting #4

Tom and I first found that the conda files for satpy are old. We needed to dowload those from the github folder. Tom has fixed the files to run on Windows and Kenza will be using her Mac. 
 
We succesfully dowloaded the data, access the arrays and produce images. The S7, S8, and S9 files channels were not accessible. The error was spotted previously by another Github user. We went into files of the library to fix this too, but it did not work. 

 
File format e.g.: 
S3A_SL_1_RBT____20180822T000619_20180822T000919_20180822T015223_0179_035_016_3240_SVL_O_NR_003.SEN3

 
ACTION KENZA make table
ACTION TOM send Kenza information 

Tom also found KLM files to plot out the satelite's ground tracks on Fusion Tables or Google Earth.This will help us easily identify which files we want to look out without having to dowload them.

Below we have generated images from a single channel, a false colour image, images with the included cloud masks, and only one of the bits in the cloud mask.

Questions:
- why are there no b channels for S1-3?
